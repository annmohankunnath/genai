Projects leveraging GenAI / LLMs. The following projects are in this folder:

1) Parameter efficient fine tuning with LoRA: The goal of this project is to first evaluate a pretrained DistilBERT model on the MultiNLI dataset, and then parameter efficient fine tune it leveraging Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
2) Custom Chatbot for question answering: The goal of the project is to build a character-driven chatbot that can generate narrative-based responses using a dataset of fictional character profiles. By leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with LangChain and OpenAI embeddings, the system retrieves relevant character data to ground responses in personality-rich, story-oriented contextsâ€”ideal for creative writing, storytelling, or ideation tasks.
