    "## Dataset: \n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses a dataset containing fictional character descriptions from theater, television, and film. Each entry provides a brief profile of an imagined character, including personality traits, background, and setting. The dataset was chosen for its creative depth and potential to support a chatbot that can respond in character-driven or narrative-based scenarios. This customization is especially useful in contexts like storytelling, creative writing, or ideation sessions where access to diverse character types can enhance the experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach for customization:\n",
    "\n",
    "The customization uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup built with LangChain. Character data is converted into text documents, embedded using OpenAI's embedding model, and stored in a FAISS vector store for similarity-based retrieval. LangChain’s ConversationalRetrievalChain ties the retriever to the gpt-3.5-turbo model. When a question is asked, relevant context is retrieved and passed into the model to generate responses grounded in the dataset."

    "\n",
    "This block sets up the full flow for a retrieval-augmented chatbot using LangChain and OpenAI. The dataset is first loaded into a document format compatible with LangChain, a framework that helps manage the different parts of a language model workflow—like connecting to models, managing context, and plugging in retrieval systems like vector stores. \n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain was the chosen framework as it strikes a good balance between flexibility and ease of use. It supports both quick prototypes and more complex use cases, with built-in tools for retrieval, memory, chains, and model integrations. For this project, LangChain made it easy to connect the OpenAI model with the character dataset using embeddings and FAISS, without needing to write a custom retrieval pipeline from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are generated using OpenAI’s embedding model, which turns each character description into a numeric representation that captures its meaning. These are stored in a FAISS vector store, which allows fast similarity searches when a question comes in—so the chatbot can retrieve the most relevant character data. Embeddings are used to represent text as high-dimensional vectors based on meaning. Instead of doing keyword matching, the system compares the user’s question to the character descriptions using vector similarity. This allows it to retrieve the most relevant entries even when the wording doesn’t match exactly. OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 model was used here because it’s lightweight, reliable, and integrates well with LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gpt-3.5-turbo model was selected because it offers a strong balance between performance, cost, and speed. It’s optimized for chat-like interactions, making it well-suited for conversational tasks like this custom chatbot. Compared to older models (like text-davinci-003), it handles dialogue better, supports longer context windows, and is more efficient in terms of token usage. Since the goal of this project is to create a chatbot that can respond naturally and contextually based on a dataset, gpt-3.5-turbo was the most practical and capable choice available. The gpt-3.5-turbo model is connected using LangChain’s ChatOpenAI, and the retrieval and model are tied together through ConversationalRetrievalChain. That setup handles everything from pulling context to generating a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "A helper function wraps it all into a simple call, making it easier to trigger responses based on user questions. The result is a chatbot that’s not just guessing—it’s pulling in actual context from the dataset and responding accordingly."
