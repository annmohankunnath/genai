    "1) Lightweight yet effective: As a distilled version of BERT, DistilBERT retains about 97% of BERT’s performance on tasks like natural language inference (NLI), while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. This makes it an efficient choice for fine-tuning without compromising much on accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Uncased variant: The model treats uppercase and lowercase letters the same, which reduces vocabulary size and simplifies training. This is particularly useful for NLI, where case sensitivity is typically not essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Seamless integration with Hugging Face tools: It is fully compatible with Hugging Face's transformers library, including AutoTokenizer and AutoModelForSequenceClassification, making setup and fine-tuning straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Pretrained on diverse data: The model has been pretrained on a large and varied text corpus (including Wikipedia and BookCorpus), providing a strong foundation for transfer learning on datasets like MultiNLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Resource-friendly: With fewer parameters than BERT, DistilBERT runs efficiently on limited hardware, making it ideal for quick experiments, smaller machines, or educational setups."

Overall, the model shows solid learning dynamics and benefits from longer training, which aligns with expectations for PEFT setups where only a small subset of parameters is being updated."

By saving only the adapter weights instead of the full model, the result is a lightweight, modular checkpoint that’s easy to share or reuse — while still capturing all the task-specific learning. This setup makes fine-tuning both efficient and practical, especially for larger models or when working with limited compute."
